"""Tests for `BuyWithCardTask` -- the reward for a shop purchase paid by card.

These score the task against states taken from the *running apps* rather than
a hand-built fixture: seed the shop and the bank, snapshot the cross-app
state, drive a real checkout through the shop's HTTP client, snapshot again.
That is the only way to catch the failure mode that matters here, which is the
target state drifting away from what a checkout actually writes (a renamed
field, a changed rounding, a second ledger row nobody expected).

`tests/test_card_payments.py` covers the authorization itself and
`tests/test_onlineshop.py::TestCheckout` the shop's side of the form; neither
knows anything about rewards.
